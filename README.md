**Food Detection Model**

The  Food101  dataset  contains  16,256  images  of  17  classes  of  foods.  The  data  can  be  split  into  training  and  testing  images, where each class can be roughly split into 70-30. Classes are typically the names of the food, e.g. apple_pie. â€¢Dataset has been attached along with this project. Please use the same for this capstone project
